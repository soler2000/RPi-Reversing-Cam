1) Flash Raspberry Pi OS Bookworm (32-bit) and boot the Pi Zero 2 W.

2) Enable camera + I2C:
   sudo raspi-config   -> Interface Options -> I2C = enable, Camera = enable
   (or let the install script do it non-interactively)

3) Clone the repo and run the installer:
   sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y git
   cd /home/pi
   git clone https://github.com/solder2000/RPi-Reversing-Cam.git
   cd RPi-Reversing-Cam
   bash scripts/install.sh

4) Reboot once (optional, good idea):
   sudo reboot

5) Start the service:
   sudo systemctl start motion_wide.service
   sudo systemctl status motion_wide.service

6) Browse from iPhone/iPad to:
   http://<pi-ip>:8000/

7) Auto AP fallback:
   - If no known Wi‑Fi within 30s, the Pi brings up an Access Point using NM's 'shared' mode.
   - Default SSID/PW: RPiCam / raspberry (change in Settings).
   - Connect to the AP and browse to http://192.168.0.1:8000/ (typical NM shared subnet).

8) Wiring quick refs:
   - VL53L1X: I2C (0x29) -> SDA/SCL pins.
   - INA219: I2C at 0x43 (config your board accordingly).
   - NeoPixel ring: DIN -> GPIO18 (pin 12), 5V->5V, GND->GND. Run service as root for PWM/DMA.

Notes:
- MJPEG is used for low-latency, iOS-friendly streaming; overlays rendered server-side via OpenCV.
- Battery % is linear from v_min to v_max (set in Settings) — tune for your UPS chemistry.

Uninstall:
  sudo systemctl disable --now motion_wide.service
  sudo rm -f /etc/systemd/system/motion_wide.service
